# Data Visualization 101

This repo sets out to achieve a few things:

 - Curate the tidbits of advice about good data visualization over the years
 - Help compare and contrast JS frameworks for the situation of "I just need a graph"
 - Collected my own snippets of boilerplate for data visualisation.

One of the other reasons I am putting this together is that I am working through 
[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web: An Introduction to Designing with D3](https://www.amazon.com.au/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Web-Introduction-ebook/dp/B074JKZ9Z3)
and I like learning by example.
